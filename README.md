# javascriptAssessment


1. What did you like about this project?
This is a simple terminal interface project that lets me zone in on just the backend code without having to worry about the output on DOM or window.  Less distraction is always good and very focused workspace. Less guidance is provided for seemingly complex game problem which is challenging my beginner level grasp of the concepts taught in class. I may not have solved the game to a fully functional one but I learned so much and that is a huge gain nevertheless.

2. What did you struggle with in this project?
A lot, the introduction of 2d array has thrown me off.  

The starter template has already provided a lot of help  but I noticed that my learning style does not adapt to this very well.  Same as when I was going through intermediate Javascript module at Codeacademy, a lot of the codes in modules (especially in modules  and promises sections) are prewritten for me and as I was expected to complete the rest of the code blocks to move past the task, I find it very difficult to follow the pre-written snippets as I did not create/wrote them myself. Have to do a lot of analysis to get the task done. 

For this project I started out from scratch for the first 4 hours but barely going anywhere. I couldn’t even print out a clean field trimmed of whitespace. I really struggled a lot and ended up using the starter template and worked my way from there.

3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I lieu of no. 2, I think just a step by step requirement / instruction and detailed specifications of them (without giving away literal answers) might be better(of course which means more time given) instead of scaffolding incomplete pieces of code.

It’s just my learning style, other people may not need to be tactical with solving coding problems.Otherwise, everything about the instruction is appreciated
